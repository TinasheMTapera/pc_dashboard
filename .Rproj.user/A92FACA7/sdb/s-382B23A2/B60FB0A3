To run this way, open the file app.R in either RStudio (recommended) or the R GUI and use runApp() in the console to start the app. File paths for helper files (e.g. Plots.R) are path relative so keep the directory structure as is (all .R files in the same directory). Necessary packages are defined and downloaded automatically (though may require some confirmation in the console).\n\n2. Run Online:\nGo to https://tinashemtapera.shinyapps.io/project/ to access the project hosted by RStudio. Please use the sample data file provided as input.",
