She has always loved stuff like that and took a couple classes this term to see how she liked it. She called her parents to tell them that she would like to switch her major. Her parents weren't happy though and they pay for her tuition. They said that if she switches her major that they will not longer pay for her. She kept talking and going in circles. Eventually she decided that she was going to talk to her parents again and explain all the career opportunities, and show that this is a good career path for her.
